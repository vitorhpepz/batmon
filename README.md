Charging monitor for MacOS

Run with: "node batmon.js". It will play an alert sound every minute if you reach over 65%.

Seems that not fully charging current batteries causes significant less wear. On Android, AccuBattery says that charging my phone from 35% to 68% "causes 0.08 cycles in wear". If this is right and the same for all equipments, battery would last 4x longer, so let's test.
